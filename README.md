# Hey-That-s-My-Fish-
An interactive board game
Description
The Penguins Game Project is an interactive C-based game inspired by the board game Hey, Thatâ€™s My Fish!. In this turn-based strategy game, two players compete to collect the most fish by moving penguins across a grid of icy tiles. Each move and placement influences the outcome, as players attempt to outmaneuver one another while gathering points.

Rules to Play
Start by inputting the amount of players (if in interactive gamemode), the board dimensions and the amount of penguings per player. To start the game each Player places penguins on tiles with exactly one fish. The second step is that each player moves its Penguins to gather fish, removing ice floes as they go. The penguins can move diagonally, up, down, left and right for up to 2 tiles. The penguins cannot "jump" over the sea or over other penguins. It is also compulsory to make a move when it is your turn. The game ends when no moves are possible, and the player with the most fish wins.
